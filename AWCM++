Example:

/project/def-alamj/shared/bin/v2306/awcmviewer -INP post_process.inp -analysis probe -time 0 -fields 'U'  -out fowf15mwR0.h5  -pwd

this command reads /path/to/case/postProcessing/probes/0/U and creates /path/to/case/statistics/xdmf/fow15mwR0.h5

This .h5 contains "data" matrix, where the first row is time.
