This notebook ( pod_ex_image.ipynb ) shows the following:

1) Download a set of images from sklearn database and display the images using matplotlib

2) Treat the images as snapshot of a fluid flow (just for demonstration purpose). Calculate the POD modes of the mean subtracted images, U-Ubar. 
   Reconstruct the images using a low rank projection.

3) Add salt and paper noise to images using numpy.random

4) Apply ADMM algorithm to decompose the noisy images into coherent (low rank) and incoherent (residual) modes.
